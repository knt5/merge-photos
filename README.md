# merge-photos
A tool to merge photos to save your phone storage

## Usage

```
npm i
node merge-photos $photoDataDirPath $outputDirPath
```

## Background
I had 65,000+ photos in my iPhone in 2019.
My [ios-photo-reduce](https://github.com/knt5/ios-photo-reduce) made possible to do that.
But the ImageCapture app on macOS was very very slow for such situation (huge number of photos).
I had wanted to save time to organize my photos.
Of course I had wanted to save storage of my phone too.
